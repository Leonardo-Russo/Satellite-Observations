# Satellite Observations

This project required us to write a matlab code which could achieve the following:

- Obtain TLE from CelesTrack to obtain a Satellite Database
- Propagate the Satellite's position and velocity up to a pre-defined moment where the observation should occur
- Check visibility of the Satellite
- Conflict Resolution betweeen the observable satellites
- Export an Orchestrate.txt file to feed to the observatory
